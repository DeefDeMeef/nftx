            <h3>Anthony de Jong</h3>
            <h3>Cyber security student</h3>
            <p>My name is Anthony de Jong and I'm a cyber security student following the blockchain minor at the University of applied sciences Amsterdam. 
              I love being a cyber security student because it gives me an opportunity to learn about technical risks and security philosophies.
              As a cyber security student, I always try and look at new and up-and-coming technology to try and learn from.
              That's what kind of led me to Blockchain. I remember hearing about this next big thing in my first semester, and I was trying to understand why it was highly rated.
              I started to understand it more and more as time went by, until I eventually even did a individual project on Blockchain during my third semester.
              My project showed me how little I knew about this subject and how interesting actually could be.
              That is how I ended up doing the Blockchain minor.
              The reason why this minor is so interesting to me is because it shows the potential Blockchain offers to security and possible applications. 
              Especially because of the decentralization that blockchain offers.
              Not having one central database to go to can offer huge possibilities and freedom to companies and parties willing to create.
              To have an idea of what companies are trying to achieve with blockchain, I wanted to go to an event that would give me an concept of how far companies are at right now. 
              That’s why I decided to go to the NFTx event, to learn more about future projects in Blockchain, and to see more exciting and innovative creations.

        <h2>The NFTx event</h2>
      <section class="paragraph">
        <p>
          My experience with the NFTx event was pretty positive. I learned a lot about how companies cope with blockchain development
          and how they use it to their advantage. To fully get a grasp of how my day went, I need to start at the beginning to give u a clear picture.
          Me and my classmates arrived at the Koepel, which is where the event was being held. It was this old prison building which was being 
          renovated into office space. This gave me and my fellow classmates the impression that this event had some prestige with it, which was a good thing. 
        <br>
        <br>
         After the volunteer group assembled, we started to shape out the event floor so it would be for people to sit there. This took
         a lot of effort because there were a lot of office chairs and desks around the main event floor. So that took a few hours 
         to set up and make it fully presentable.  After that we just had to sit there and wait till the event started so we could provide support.
         So, we did have some free time to go and enjoy the event. I talked to some stands like this stand called Zeedz.io which is a play-for-purpose game where players reduce global carbon emissions by collecting plant-inspired creatures called: Zeedles. Apparently, they live as NFTs on an eco-friendly blockchain called 
         Flow and grow with the real-world weather. Besides that, there was a cool NFT auction you could witness live, which was hosted by the pretty official auctioneers of Sotheby’s.
         It was interesting because of the amount some of the NFTs went for were just insane.
        <br> 
        <br>
          After the auction everybody got split up into breakout rooms, where there were workshops like "Governance of NFTs and by NFTs, mechanisms, opportunities and risks"
          and "How to make a generative NFT project". I was one of the unlucky ones that wasn't able to attend one of these because I had to stay at the main event floor to help
          people. When these workshops ended, everybody was guided to the main event floor to for the ending ceremony of the event. The event ended with an artist creating the painting you see on the right within 10 minutes. So it could be auctioned and 
          be minted as an NFT, which was a nice way to end the event in my opinion.
        <br> 
        <br>
        In my opinion, I learned a lot about fun projects that are being created with the power of Blockchain.
        It still baffles me that there are ideas created that are so unique. If I had the change to go to another 
        NFTx event or an event just like it, I would definitly do it again.
