            <h4>HBO-ICT Software engineering</h4>
            <p>I am currently in my third year of studying software engineering. At the moment, I am doing my Blockchain minor. In this minor you will learn how to program smart contracts and learn to work with blockchain technology. Because of this, we also got the chance to help out at the NFTX event.</p>

        <p>At the NFTX event in Haarlem, I volunteered to help with the work that needed to be done. We prepared all breakout rooms and at the beginning of the event I was scanning tickets of visitors. Here you could also have a small chat with the visitors and talk about NFT's together. I was also present at one of the breakout rooms to help during the session itself. I was helping at the Education Newbie breakout room. This was a presentation held by Hans Geldof from the company Mercurious.</br></br>

          He has a lot of experience in the blockchain world and also many things related to it such as NFTs. The audience in the breakout room was generally older people but also some younger people who had no idea what an NFT was or how it worked. In the presentation, the basics of blockchain technology were explained and in this way, the NFT concept was further explained. Also the value of an NFT and how and where you can buy one was discussed. Also the risks were discussed and what people should take into account.</br></br>
          
          For most of the session, questions were asked from the audience and these were then answered, which led to some interesting discussions between the speaker and the audience. The blockchain concept remains a vague one for many, which they find hard to accept. It is a certain way of thinking, but the transition is definitely there. And that was certainly felt in the breakout room. People were critical but tried their best to understand the concept. I didn't learn much about NFT's during the breakout room because the information was very simple, but I did learn a lot about how other people look at NFT's and this gives you a new view on certain topics within the blockchain world.</p>
