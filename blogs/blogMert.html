            <p>The NFTX event was for me a great experience to see how many people are interested in the blockchain technology. Since NFT's are up and rising currently, I always wanted to know what a NFT is and why it is so special. When I was helping in the breakout room about laws and regulations. I started to see that a NFT isn't just a piece of art. After the event I gained a wider view about NFT's thanks to the staff and the people. It was a pleasure to be part of the event and hopefully I get an another opportunity to help again, thankyou!</p>
