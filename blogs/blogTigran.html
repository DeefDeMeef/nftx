            <h3>Tigran Staroverov</h3>
            <h4>Cyber Security Student</h4>
            <p>My name is Tigran Staroverov, a third year Cyber Security student at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam. Before this I had my own multi-media company for a couple of years, but now I found my passion in cyber security. Meanwhile, in addition to my current studies, I am working as a salesperson on bol.com and amazon. So I started importing goods from China, and selling them on different platforms. In addition, I also tried to post a few NFT artworks on OpenSea for fun, but no success so far with that. Currently I am following a Blockchain Minor which I'm really enjoying. We were selected to help as volunteers at the NFTx Event in de Koepel, Haarlem, so I wrote a nice piece about my experience and the things I learned at my breakout room session. </p>

        <p>As part of my Minor Blockchain I am following, I had the opportunity to participate in the biggest NFT event in the Netherlands - NFTx Event in de Koepel, Haarlem. We supported the event by helping out where we could. Learned super much about NFTs, not only programming them within the Blockchain, but also everything regarding the marketing and design that is involved with it.

		Met a lot of people too! Rico Verhoeven came to check out how the NFT world works and I even met and I even had the chance to speak with the creator and CEO of the CryptoPunks NFT Collection! Simply an honor. I took part in the Breakout Room Session called 'How to make a generative NFT collection'. I will go in depth on what I learned at this session in the following chapters.

        *Breakout Room - How to make a generative NFT collection*
		<br><br>
        Starting from CryptoPunks to that of Bored Ape Yacht Club, NFTs have just begun taking hold of the blockchain industry making big moves and have since emerged as the next biggest thing next to the cryptocurrencies. With celebrity endorsements and jaw-dropping sales from several high-profile NFTs, interest in making NFTs art has never really been that high.
		<br><br>
		NFT is an acronym for Non Fungible Token. It is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain in the form of a digital ledger. These data units act as proof of ownership for objects associated with them that can be created, traded and owned. The objects can be real or virtual, but are typically unique and scarce. Unlike cryptocurrencies, each token is unique and cannot be exchanged. Imagine that a U.S. dollar is synonymous with a Bitcoin and an NFT with the painting of Mona Lisa. Each dollar bill can be exchanged for another dollar bill of the same value, but there can only be one Mona Lisa painting. Most NFTs are large collections of similar themes, algorithmically generated. There are many algorithmic approaches to generating NFTs, in the breakout room we had a presentation and walkthrough of one of the methods made popular by the Weirdwhales collection using a simple Python script. Most generative NFT arts share a basic set of attributes or properties that can be arbitrarily layered to create a unique work of art. Take CryptoPunks for example, there are 5 basic punk types (alien, monkey, zombie, etc.) and 87 possible attributions (beanie, cigarette, earring, etc.). The attributes can also be modified programmatically to emphasize the rarity of certain figures. So in order to create a generative NFT collection, all you need is a little bit of Graphic Design (just to make a few objects), and you'll need a little bit of programming - however, this last part is extremely easy to do nowadays. That has to do with the fact that a lot of the resources that are needed have been released as Open Source projects on the web. This makes it incredibly easy to create your own generative collection of let's say 10.000 NFT's. All generated in a few minutes by a simple Python script and a few graphic models, either in PNG/JPG or even SVG format. It's even possible to make 3D objects by creating the images through a 3D software like Blender for example.
		<br><br>
		What I also learned from the breakout room session what that nowadays, because it's so simple to create a full generative NFT collection and upload it on the markets for free, it is not the one-way ticket to success. This has to do with the fact that too many people are using this trick already. This means that it's not so much about the technique behind it anymore, but about the marketing aspect that comes along with it. This is the part that is being forgotten most of the time. It's easy to create an NFT collection, but to sell it is a whole different story.
