        <p>On the 16th of february I had the pleasure to volunteer at the NFTx event. This became possible by the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS). Our day started early, the location of the NFTx was beautiful. It was an old prison that was being rebuilt for other purposes, but the architecture inside still had some reminiscences of the old prison. Which gave it a cool vibe. After 
          looking around, we had an introduction of what we were going to do and what needed to be set up. My task was to arrange the table and seats for each
          room where there would be presented. Searching for the tables and chairs was sometimes difficult, because some doors in the prison were closed and others were open. It was kind of a maze,
          where we sometimes had to walk upstairs and then downstairs to bypass the locked doors. After everything was finished, we had some dinner and we were told what we were going to do and in which room we were placed.
          My task was guiding the visitors to the main event. I was standing at ground floor and guiding the visitors upstairs. There were also some famous visitors, like Rico Verhoeven, Kwebbelkop and the creator of Cryptopunk. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After the main event I went to the room where I was placed. The presentor of that room was Maarten Smakman, I had some little chat with him about blockchain and NFTs. I myself am a bit scepitcal about NFTs. I do not see the purpose of NFTs. 
          Maarten had some experience with NFTs and his presentation was about an NFT project he had done. So I was curious about his usage of NFTs. His presentation was about the exploration of decentralization in the digital realm with 
          the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT’s). With a glass ball as focal point, social-economic experiments with NFT’s are being deployed. At the initial launch of the project, it was possible to buy tokens of the project so that all holders shared ownership. In the glass ball there was a server stored with an address, where only blockchain and NFT stuff could be sent.
          The only way to access the stuff stored on the server was if all token holders of the Copernicus project all decided that the glass ball should be destroyed to access the server. The token holders could also decide where the glass ball was presented around the world. Maarten Smakman aslo invited me to come to the Ethereum event in april.
        </p>
        <p>
          The presentation definitely opened a new world for me of NFTs. I do not find them so useless anymore and found there were use cases for them. I think for art, NFTs are great, but I still want to see real life use cases of NFTs. Is it possible to cut the middle men with NFTs? What will happen when a hacker steals your NFT that for example gives you ownership of a virtual house?
          The future of NFTs will be intriguing. The experiment with Copernicus gave some inside view what the future will hold for NFTs.
          An interesting bit was when the holders would decide to destroy the glass ball to access the server, so that everything that was sent to the address could be accessed and sold.
        </p>
        <p>I would like to thank the organizers of the NFTx event for giving me the oppertunity to volunteer and learn new experiences. I also would like to thank Maarten Smakman for his presentation and hospitality</p>
