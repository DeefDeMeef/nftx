            <h4>Creative Developer / CMD Student</h4>
            <p>Hi, I'm Davey. I'm studying Communication and Multimedia Design at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. Here I learn about
            design (UI/UX) and frontend development. For my minor I chose Blockchain because I am very interested in this
            technology. Besides school I work as a Creative Developer at an agency in Amsterdam, where I do a lot of different
            custom development projects from A to Z. So strategies, designs, development etc. With HvA I was able to contribute as a
            volunteer to the NFTx event in Haarlem, what I have done and seen here will be told through this article.</p>

        <p>On February 16, 2022, I was allowed to volunteer to help at the largest NFT event in the Netherlands. The location was
        in the dome, Haarlem. This is a very cool place because it used to be a state prison and is now being renovated into a
        school campus fully focused on digital technologies. Nice that an NFT event is given at such a place. When I arrived at
        the event I did not know what to expect or what to do, so we first had a briefing and all volunteers were assigned to a
        task. My first task was to prepare a number of rooms for presentation by means of chairs, tables and bottles of water.
        For this we received floor plans so we knew what had to be done. After this was done the event started at 13h. My job
        was to scan tickets and explain to the visitors where to go. During the ticket scanning I came across many Dutch
        celebrities whose ticket I had to scan, such as Rico Verhoeven, Louis Klibansky and the CEO of Cryptopunks (very famous
        NFT collection). Pictures are at the bottom of this article.<br><br> Something I found very special was that I went outside to
        smoke (I know, super bad) but then there was a man smoking alone so I walked up to him and started talking about the
        event and why we were here. So in the end this guy turned out to be the CEO of Cryptopunks, it's pretty separate to
        realize this that I spent a whole time talking to someone like that but it was very informative and it gave me
        motivation to finish my minor. I was even more excited about it after this.
        <br><br>
        After I scanned the tickets and everyone was in, the main event started and there they were going to talk to different
        guest speakers about blockchain technology and about the future of it. When this was over the breakout sessions started.
        I got to help out at the 'Governance' session, this session was about how NFT projects are governed, emphasizing not
        only on the endless opportunities, but paint an honest picture by also demystifying NFTs and look at the risk.
        <br><br>
        At first I was not very enthusiastic about this topic but during the presentation I still learned something. For
        example, you can easily find out how reliable an NFT project is by scanning their code yourself or using etherscan to
        have it scanned. For example, there may be a self-destruct button in the contract that can burst all tokens. For an
        investor this is a risk you have to think about but also as a creator. These are points that few people talk about
        because they are drowned out by the hype of NFTs. In short NFTs are super cool but there are definitely more risks
        associated with this except that it is going to be worth less.
        <br><br>
        After the sessions we were free to walk around the event and have a drink with all the guests. So I stood drinking a
        beer next to Kwebbelkop, quite a crazy idea but very nice.
        <br><br>
        This was my experience of the NFTx event, hopefully you enjoyed reading this short article.
